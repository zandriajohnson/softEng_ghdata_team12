GHData is a Python library and REST server that provides data related to GitHub repositories. Hosting the GHData project requires a copy of the [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html).

GHData is under heavy development; expect frequent backwards-incompatible changes until a 1.x.x release!

Dependencies
------------

- Python 3.4.x and `pip`
- MySQL 5.x or later with the [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/) [MSR14 dataset](http://ghtorrent.org/) for testing
  - [Installation instructions](https://github.com/gousiosg/github-mirror/tree/master/sql)

Installation
------------

First, install ghdata

- Stable: `pip install --upgrade https://github.com/OSSHealth/ghdata/archive/master.zip`
- Development: `git clone -b dev https://github.com/OSSHealth/ghdata/ && pip install --upgrade ./ghdata/`

Then, run `ghdata` to create a new config file. Edit the generated `ghdata.cfg` file with your database settings.

Run `ghdata` again. For development, use `make run-debug`, that will start the server with Werkzeug's debugging on.

Usage
-----

To run GHData as a server: 
  1. Type `ghdata` in a terminal. A config file named ghdata.cfg will be generated. 
  2. Edit the ghdata.cfg file with your database settings. 
  3. Type `ghdata` again to start the server.


To use as a Python package:
```python
from ghdata import GHData

client = GHData('mysql+pymysql://<user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>/<database name>')
railsID = client.repoid(owner='rails', repo='rails')
railsStars = client.stargazers(railsID)
```

Uninstall
------------
To uninstall, run `pip uninstall ghdata`
